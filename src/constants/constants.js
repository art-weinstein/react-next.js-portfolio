    description: "A basic program language survey designed to practice branching with JavaScript. This language suggester gives the user five survey prompts. Based on their answers, the program returns a gif with a small statment telling them what computer language they are most likely to enjoy. Every possible combination is not coded, therefore if a combination is chosen that is not in the program, it prompts the user to try again.",
